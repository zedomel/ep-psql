# EP - Graph visualization and documents indexing
### Installation
* Install Play! Framework:
    * Download and install Play! Framework: [play]
* Install PostgreSQL :
    * Download and install PostgreSQL server: [pgsql]

### Compile
* Compile using Play! activator:
    * Enter into project directory, initialize activator and compile:
    ```sh 
       $ cd ep-psql
       $ activator 
       [ep-psql] $ compile
    ```
    It will download all dependencies and compile the application.

### Run application in Dev. mode
* Launch application using activator:
```sh
    $ cd ep-psql
    $ activator
    [ep-psql] $ run
```
Application will start, usually at http://localhost:9000

## DEPLOYING (FOR PRODUCTION ONLY)

### Preparing for Deploy

* Generating an application secret:

```sh
[ep-psql] $ playGenerateSecret
[info] Generated new secret: QCYtAnfkaZiwrNwnxIlR6CTfG3gf90Latabg5241ABR5W1uDFNIkn
[success] Total time: 0 s, completed 28/03/2014 2:26:09 PM
```

* Using dist task:

```sh
[ep-psql] $ dist
```

This produces a ZIP file containing all JAR files needed to run your application in the `target/universal` folder of your application.

* Running application:

Unzip the file located at `target/universal` and then run the script in the `bin` directory (on windows use `.bat` script):

```sh
$ unzip ep-psql-1.0-SNAPSHOT.zip
$ ep-psql-1.0-SNAPSHOT/bin/ep-psql -Dplay.crypto.secret=abcdefghijk
```

Replacing the application secret for your secret generated before.
